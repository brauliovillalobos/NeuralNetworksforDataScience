The course provides a general set of tools and principles to understand deep networks as compositions of differentiable blocks, that are optimized numerically.

Then, it overviews common building blocks including convolutions, self-attention, batch normalization, etc., with a focus on image, audio, and graph domains. Towards the end, it overviews the deployment of these models (adversarial robustness, interpretability, Dockerization), and some selected state-of-the-art research topics (continual learning, self-supervised learning, â€¦).

The course combines rigorous mathematical descriptions with many coding sessions in TensorFlow.
